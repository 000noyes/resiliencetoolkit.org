        <p class="mb-4">Gather regularly to be joyful and have fun with your community. This is how we build the relationships that are the foundation for communication, mutual aid and rapid response in times of crisis. Many local institutions like schools, libraries and business may already be primed to host these events, but usually they need people to make it happen.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">As a practice of baseline resilience, host regular community meetings on a recurring day of the month (e.g. third Thursdays) in a consistent location. Provide food if you are able, or make it a potluck. If you are hosting a public assembly in which decisions are getting made about local governance, check out <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nUkRdNmMf4eisAdmVFbGJKiCiEiea6Cv/view">how to host a public assembly</a>, pages 11, 18-25.
