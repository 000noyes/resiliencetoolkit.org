        This toolkit was compiled in the aftermath of flooding in 2023 and 2024 in Vermont for communities, mutual aid groups, local organizations, and municipalities to use in assessing and building resilience to disaster and disruption.

        <p class="text-muted-foreground">
          We are community members, organizers, and caretakers. We made this toolkit because we needed it when the waters rose. We hope you choose to use this toolkit as a starting place to develop a Resilience Hub that supports your community in the day-to-day and when acute disaster strikes. You may also find this toolkit useful if you’re located somewhere else with a lot of rain, mountains, and people living in floodplains.

        <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
          This toolkit is the result of countless people caring enough to show up, again and again, for their communities, then write down what they learned. It is a testament to the expertise that comes from lived experience, and the result of countless minds and hearts collaborating to identify a gap and help fill it. 
        </p>

        <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
          This toolkit was compiled by frontline, grassroots flood responders across Vermont in the wake of flooding in 2023 and 2024, and we humbly present the first edition of this toolkit in fall of 2025. This toolkit will continue to change as communities do.
